A library for Node.js-flavored Javascript providing facilities for making a more expressive language.  The libraries will promote certain idioms (including, but not limited to those outlined by Mr. Crockford) and will include the following:

+  good parts language parser
+  big decimal
+  rationals
+  concurrency
+  immutable data structs
+  currying 
+  partial functions
+  functional composition 
+  functors
+  advice 
+  combinators
+  traits
+  more...

Some of these things are total pie-in-the-sky, but fun to think about anyway.  :-)
